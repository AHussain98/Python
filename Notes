python data is strongly typed and dynamically typed, so you cant add a string to a int, but you dont need to declare data types of variables
in python, we can use single quotes or double quotes to enclose strings
in python, all functions return a value
variable assignment is done using the equals symbol, anything on the right of the symbol gets executed first and then the assignmnet happens
you can multiply strings by ints in python, such as when printing them multiple times
input function returns a string by default
